# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring team members per title, and identify team members who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

* We can draw many conclusions from the data. The biggest conclusion is that Senior titled team members have the highest average of retirement opportunities.

* With the retirment_titles table we are able to see every eligible team member for retirement and how long they have worked at each position over the course of their career.

* The unique_titles table that we created shows the most recent title for team members of retirement age.

* The mentorship_eligibilty table we created shows which team members and titles are eligble to be a mentor.

## Summary

In conclusion, we would advise that Pewlett-Hackard strongly considers hiring on more team members quickly. The reasoning behind this is that there are 90,398 roles that would need to be filled out as soon as the workforce starts retiring. In addition to those retiring, there are only around 1900 team members eligible to be a mentor. With needing to fill in many roles due to retirement, more mentors would be needed so it's not too taxing on those that are mentor-eligble currently. While team members might not retire right away, it's important to note that they are eligible, and at any given moment they could. With this in mind, it's urgent to bring up new team members to replace those roles or at least have them in mind for the roles when/if they become open. We could leverage more tables and data to better advise on moving team members from any one given area to back-fill positions if they become open due to retirement. Another option would be using data to predict when on average people did retire, given the data and dates of retirement.
